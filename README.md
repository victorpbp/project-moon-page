# What is this project?

[Link to the Website](https://victorpbp.github.io/project-moon-page/).

This project was made in order to introduce people to the Project Moon universe, with brief lore, exposition, ambience and answering a few questions.

We hope to help you join this unstable and unique world.

## Who made this?

It was made by [me, Victor](https://github.com/victorpbp) (Coder) and my friend [Musicii](https://github.com/Musicii-bit) (Designer)

The content (images and some descriptions) was taken from a myriad of places, from the Steam Page, the artbooks, the fandom, etc...

## What was the stack?

This is a [React](https://react.dev/) project running with [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/) CSS library.

To run the project in your own local, please:

1 - Make sure to run "npm install" in order to download all the dependencies.

2 - Run "npm start" in order to boot up the project in the standard port (usually localhost:3000 if nothing else is utilizing it).

There you go!
